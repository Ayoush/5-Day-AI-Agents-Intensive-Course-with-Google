# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

Welcome! This repository documents my personal learning journey through Google's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course. Beyond just completing the course materials, I'm building additional examples, experimenting with concepts locally, and creating comprehensive notes to deepen my understanding.

## My Learning Approach

While the course provides excellent foundational materials, I'm going beyond the standard curriculum by:

- **Building Local Examples:** Creating practical, runnable examples that demonstrate concepts in different contexts
- **Comprehensive Note-Taking:** Documenting insights from whitepapers and hands-on experimentation
- **Dual Implementation:** Working through exercises both on Kaggle (for the official codelabs) and locally (for extended experimentation)
- **Concept Exploration:** Developing additional examples that explore edge cases and real-world applications

## Course Overview

This 5-day online program, crafted by Google's ML researchers and engineers, helps developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents.

**Key concepts covered:**

- Core agent components: Models, Tools, Orchestration, Memory, and Evaluation.
- Agent Ops: Reliability, governance, and security.
- Practical application: Building agents with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini.
- Interoperability: Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for complex, long-running operations.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Core Model:** Google Gemini
- **Framework:** Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Platform:** Kaggle (for Codelabs) + Local Environment
- **Language:** Python
- **Support Tool:** NotebookLM

## Repository Structure

Each day follows this structure:
```
Day X/
├── whitepaper-notes/   # Notes from course whitepapers
├── notebooks/          # Local Jupyter notebooks with examples
└── examples/           # Additional practical examples beyond course materials
```

## Daily Assignments & My Work

### Day 1: Introduction to Agents

**Course Topic:** Introduces a taxonomy of agent capabilities, the need for an "Agent Ops" discipline, and the importance of interoperability and security.

**Course Materials:**
- **Whitepaper:** "Introduction to Agents"
- **Podcast:** Unit 1 Summary (via NotebookLM)
- **Codelabs (Kaggle):**
  - [Day 1a: From Prompt to Action - Build your first agent using Gemini and ADK](https://www.kaggle.com/code/meph0x/day-1a-from-prompt-to-action)
  - [Day 1b: Agent Architectures - Build your first multi-agent systems using ADK](https://www.kaggle.com/code/meph0x/day-1b-agent-architectures)

**My Additional Work:**
- 📝 Whitepaper notes and key takeaways
- 💻 Local notebook implementations exploring agent concepts
- 🚀 Extended examples demonstrating practical use cases

### Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability (MCP)

**Course Topic:** Focuses on external tools and functions that allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data. Introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for complex operations.

**Course Materials:**
- **Whitepaper:** "Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
- **Podcast:** Unit 2 Summary (via NotebookLM)
- **Codelabs (Kaggle):**
  - Explore new ways to add tools to extend what your agents can do
  - Explore best practices for tools, including MCP and long-running operations

**My Additional Work:**
- 📝 Whitepaper notes and key takeaways
- 💻 Local notebook implementations exploring tools and MCP
- 🚀 Extended examples demonstrating tool integration patterns

### Day 3 (Nov 11, 2025)

Materials will be added as the course progresses.

### Day 4 (Nov 12, 2025)

Materials will be added as the course progresses.

### Day 5 (Nov 13, 2025)

Materials will be added as the course progresses.

## What Makes This Repository Different

While many participants may simply complete the course materials, this repository includes:

1. **Extended Examples:** Practical implementations that go beyond the course exercises
2. **Local Development:** Full working examples you can run in your own environment
3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed notes from whitepapers and hands-on experiments
4. **Learning Journey:** A transparent view of the learning process, including experiments and iterations

## Getting Started

If you're following along or want to explore the examples:

1. Each day's folder contains organized materials
2. Kaggle notebooks are linked for the official codelabs
3. Local notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder can be run in your environment
4. Check the `examples/` folder for extended practical applications
